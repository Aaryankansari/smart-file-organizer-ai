Abstract:
This document outlines a comprehensive proposal for developing an AI-powered file organization system. The system will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically categorize, tag, and organize files based on their content.

Key Features:
1. Multimodal AI analysis
2. Intelligent caching
3. Batch processing
4. Metadata embedding

The project aims to revolutionize how users manage their digital assets by providing an intelligent, automated solution that understands file content rather than relying solely on filenames.
